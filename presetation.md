Hello Everyone,

My name is Di, and the app I created for my stackathon is Woflow.

This app aims to combine the functionalities of a traditional timer, to-do list, and a calendar.

I am an accountant, and where a lot of my work is project-based and billed hourly. So what we do is we plann out the hours that all the projects will take over the entire tax seasons.

And as tasks coming in over time, there is this need to keep re-priorizing and figure out what should be the next thing to work on.

And we are talking about 20-30 things to do here. So the challenges here is not just to keep a complete list of those to-do items, or to see when they need to happen on the calendar, because everything eventually needs to be done, and their order can change all the time.
